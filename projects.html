                                The client for this project wanted a homepage which tracked the progress of the decompilation of the Nintendo 64 title "Silicon Space Station Valley" (SSSV)
                                which remained faithful to the design of the menu screen on the Nintendo 64. The comparison image supplied by the client to try and match is as follows: <a href="assets/sssv-ingame.png">Link</a>

                                The main challenges surrounding the website project here revolved around recreating the rainbow effect on the bottom bar and the donut chart which
                                represents completion of various segments of the decompilation. Hovering over a donut chart segment will change the information displayed on the right-hand side to match the various
                                segments, with the data being pulled by a JSON file that is generated upon progress being made on the decompilation project. The decision to represent the information this way was also done to mimic the in-game aesthetics.

                                The client for this project wanted a website to represent their new legal practice that they were setting up. The project involved regular liaising with the client
                                to perfect the website to their liking as well as setting up an email service for them to use a custom domain tailored to their new business.

                                Whilst working for Experian, we were in the process of updating old process methods to more modern technologies. This included a position creation wizard which
                                was originally coded by another employee as an Excel VB macro that would send our sector of Experian an email containing a CSV of the response.
                                The main problem with this at the time is version control, as users of the old wizard would have outdated versions of the Excel document and therefore
                                requests may be out of date.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As such, I created a website which would respond to a daily feed from Oracle so that users would always have the most up-to-date data along with the most up-to-date
                                procedure for position creation. The other major benefit of this over the old method was the inclusion of adding all requests to a database. This meant that a unique webpage
                                would be created for each request which we could work with a lot easier than a CSV.

                                Upon similar modifications being made for other Nintendo 64 titles, notably Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie, a client approached me about making a 
                                Practice ROM for the Nintendo 64 title "Donkey Kong 64". This modification helps with users learning how to speedrun Donkey Kong 64 as well as 
                                assisting with glitch hunting and routing. The entire Practice ROM is coded mostly with C, but with some small amounts of MIPS assembler 
                                (the assembly language that is processed by the Nintendo 64's processor). This project was my first time coding with python, C and MIPS ASM.

                                On top of making the Practice ROM, I also made a website that would accompany the Practice ROM to serve as documentation on past versions, installation 
                                methods and features.

                                Donkey Kong 64 Randomizer is a website that modifies a ROM of the Nintendo 64 title "Donkey Kong 64" to randomize gameplay elements. This project involved 
                                collaboration between myself and 11 other developers who had varying specializations with regard to coding. The role I undertook was making the base 
                                modification that the website would use to create a randomized experience. However, I also undertook roles with helping build the website and create python 
                                code to randomize various game elements.

                                ScriptHawk is a tool for the Nintendo 64 emulator "BizHawk" that gives the player power to view in-game variables with additional context provided 
                                to them as well as perform administrative-like tasks on the game to bypass various restrictions for the purpose of glitch hunting. BizHawk enables the ability 
                                to run LUA scripts and read & write memory values. I was brought onto the ScriptHawk developer team in 2017 originally to assist with flag documentation, 
                                but after a couple months, I started to assist with creating new functionality to the LUA script.
